        "Solution": "The given expression is the expansion of $(9+1)^3$.  In general, the cube of $(x+y)^3$ is \\\\[(x+y)^3=1x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+1y^3.\\\\]   The first and last terms in the given expression are cubes and the middle two terms both have coefficient 3, giving us a clue that this is a cube of a binomial and can be written in the form \\\\[(x+y)^3\\\\]In this case, $x=9$ and $y=1$, so our answer is\\\\[(9+1)^3\\\\ = 10^3 = \\\\boxed{1000}\\\\]",

        "Question": "If two distinct members of the set $\\\\{ 3, 7, 21, 27, 35, 42, 51 \\\\}$ are randomly selected and multiplied, what is the probability that the product is a multiple of 63? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "Solution": "In order to produce a multiple of 63, we must choose at least two factors of 3 and one factor of 7 among the prime factorizations of the two numbers we choose.  We count the number of ways in which we can do this by considering the four multiples of 7 in our list.  There are two which are not multiples of 3 (7 and 35) and two that are multiples of 3 but not 9 (21 and 42).  Each of 7 and 35 can be paired with 27 to give a multiple of 63, so that's two successes.  Each of 21 and 42 can be paired with any of 3, 27, or 51, which gives another $2\\\\cdot 3 = 6$ successes.  Finally, we can choose both 21 and 42, and we have a total of $2+6+1 = 9$ successes.\\n\\nSince there are $\\\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total ways to choose a pair of numbers from the list, the probability that a randomly chosen pair of numbers will have a product which is a multiple of 63 is $\\\\frac{9}{21}=\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{3}{7}}$.",

        "Question": "Square ABCD has its center at $(8,-8)$ and has an area of 4 square units. The top side of the square is horizontal. The square is then dilated with the dilation center at (0,0) and a scale factor of 2. What are the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square ABCD that is farthest from the origin? Give your answer as an ordered pair.\"",
        "Solution": "With the center of dilation at the origin and a scale factor of 2, all the coordinates of square $ABCD$ are twice the coordinates of its preimage. The preimage has an area of 4 square units, so its side length is 2 units. Since the center of the preimage is at $(8, -8)$, the four vertices of the preimage are at $(7, -9), (7, -7), (9, -7)$ and $(9, -9)$. The point $(9, -9)$ is the farthest from the origin on the preimage, so the point farthest from the origin on the image of square $ABCD$ is $\\\\boxed{(18, -18)}.$",

Extend number line diagrams and coordinate axes familiar from previous grades to represent points on the line and in the plane with negative number coordinates.\n* 6.NS.C.8: Solve real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane. Include use of coordinates and absolute value to find distances between points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate.\n* 6.G.A.3: Draw polygons in the coordinate plane given coordinates for the vertices; use coordinates to find the length of a side joining points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate. Apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.\n* 6.EE.A.2.a: Write, read, and evaluate expressions in which letters stand for numbers.\n* 6.EE.B.6: Use variables to represent numbers and write expressions when solving a real-world or mathematical problem; understand that a variable can represent an unknown number, or, depending on the purpose at hand, any number in a specified set."
