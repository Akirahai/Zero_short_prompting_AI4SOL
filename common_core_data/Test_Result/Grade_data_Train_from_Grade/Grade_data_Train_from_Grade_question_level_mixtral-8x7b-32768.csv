1. 5.G.A.1: Use a pair of perpendicular number lines, called axes, to define a coordinate system, with the intersection of the lines (the origin) arranged to coincide with the 0 on each line and a given point in the plane located by using an ordered pair of numbers, called its coordinates. Understand that the first number indicates how far to travel from the origin in the direction of one axis.

3. 5.G.B.3: Understand that attributes belonging to a category of two-dimensional figures also belong to all subcategories of that category. For example, all rectangles have four right angles and squares are rectangles, so all squares have four right angles.

Explanation:
The question asks about locating a point on the coordinate plane using an ordered pair. This directly relates to the concept of a coordinate system as defined in 5.G.A.1. The first number in the ordered pair indicates the movement from the origin along one axis, which is the x-axis in this case. The answer choice that corresponds to moving 4 units to the right (option A) aligns with this understanding.

The question also involves interpreting coordinate values in the context of the coordinate plane, which is covered in 5.G.A.2. The ability to determine the direction of movement based on the first number in the ordered pair is a part of this interpretation.

Lastly, the question requires understanding that the first number in the ordered pair relates to the x-axis, which is a property of two-dimensional figures (5.G.B.3). In this case, the x-coordinate is 4, which means the point is 4 units to the right of the origin on the x-axis."

First, we can use the quotient (26) and the remainder (13) to write an equation: 403 = 26 * number + 13. We can then use the greatest common factor of 403 and 13 to simplify the equation and find the number Justin divided by. In this case, the greatest common factor of 403 and 13 is 13, so we can divide both sides of the equation by 13 to get: 31 = 2 * number. Therefore, the number Justin divided by is 15."

To find the area of the right triangle, you need to apply the formula for the area of a right triangle, which is A = 1/2(base)(height). The base and height of the triangle are given in the question as 12 meters and 5 meters, respectively. Therefore, the area of the triangle can be calculated by finding 1/2(12)(5).

However, the given base and height are fractions of the actual lengths because they are only measuring the lengths of the sides along the gridlines. To find the exact lengths, you need to interpret and compute quotients of fractions by dividing the given lengths by the distance between the gridlines. In this case, the distance between the gridlines is 1 meter.

Lastly, the result of the calculation will be a fraction, so you need to write and evaluate numerical expressions involving whole-number exponents to express the area as a square meter value."

3. 3.NF.A.3: Explain equivalence of fractions in special cases, and compare fractions by reasoning about their size

Explanation:
The question asks for the fraction of children on the bus who are wearing hats. Since each child is wearing a hat, this means that 100% or 1 of the children are wearing hats. This can be represented as a fraction with a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 6, which is the total number of children on the bus.

To understand this, the student needs to know that a fraction represents a part of a whole, and that the numerator represents the number of parts being considered, while the denominator represents the total number of parts in the whole. In this case, the whole is the 6 children on the bus, and the numerator is 1 (representing the fact that all of the children are wearing hats).

The student also needs to be able to represent fractions on a number line, as this can help them to visualize the size of the fraction and understand its value.

Finally, the student should be able to explain the equivalence of fractions in special cases, and compare fractions by reasoning about their size. This will help them to understand that the fraction 1/6 is equivalent to 100%, and that it represents the same value as the whole number 6."

Explanation:
To solve this problem, the student needs to understand that the number of sheets of plywood used for building 12 houses is the product of the number of sheets used per house and the number of houses. This requires the application of knowledge component 5.NBT.B.5, which involves multiplying multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.

The problem can be solved by calculating 184 x 12. However, if the student does not know the multiplication fact for 184 x 12, they may need to use the partial products method, which involves multiplying each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number and then adding the resulting products. This requires the use of parentheses or brackets to organize the calculation, which is where knowledge component 5.OA.A.1 comes in.

Finally, the student needs to understand that the result of the calculation represents the total number of sheets of plywood that will be used, which is a whole number. This requires the application of knowledge component 5.NBT.B.6, which involves finding whole-number quotients of whole numbers with up to four-digit dividends and two-digit divisors."

Explanation:
The question asks for the shape of the car window. The given image shows a four-sided shape with parallel opposite sides and four right angles. This shape can be described as a rectangle (5.G.B.3). The other options provided in the question are trapezoid, rhombus, and quadrilateral. A trapezoid has only one pair of parallel sides, so it does not fit the shape in the image. A rhombus has four equal sides, which is not the case in the image. A quadrilateral is a four-sided shape, but it does not provide enough information to determine if it is a rectangle or not. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: trapezoid, rectangle.

The knowledge components required to answer this question include understanding the properties of two-dimensional shapes (5.G.B.3, 5.G.B.4) and being able to identify and classify shapes based on their properties.

Explanation:
To answer these questions, the student needs to understand how to find the area of a circle, which is covered by Common Core standard 6.G.A.1. This standard involves composing or decomposing shapes into rectangles or triangles to find their area. In this case, the student needs to know that the area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.

For part a, the student needs to know that the radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. In this case, the radius is half the length of the diameter, which is given as 14 yards.

For parts b and c, the student needs to know that the circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, and the area is given by the formula A = πr^2. To find the circumference, the student needs to substitute the value of the radius into the formula for the circumference. To find the area, the student needs to substitute the value of the radius into the formula for the area.

For part d, the student needs to know that the total area of the ground covered with grass is the area of the square park minus the area of the circular pool. The area of the square park is given as 100 x 100 = 10,000 square yards. The student needs to subtract the area of the circular pool from this value to find the total area of the grass."

1. ""4.NF.A.2"" - Compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators, e.g., by creating common denominators or numerators.
2. ""4.NF.C.5"" - Express a fraction with denominator 10 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 100, and use this technique to add two fractions with respective denominators 10 and 100.
3. ""4.NBT.A.2"" - Read and write multi-digit whole numbers using base-ten numerals, number names, and expanded form. Compare two multi-digit numbers based on meanings of the digits in each place.

Explanation:

To solve the problem, the student needs to understand how to compare and add fractions with different denominators. The fractions given are $\frac{7}{100}$ and $\frac{4}{10}$. To add these fractions, the student must first convert them to have a common denominator, which is 100 in this case. This aligns with the knowledge component ""4.NF.A.2"".

Next, the student should add the numerators, which results in $\frac{7+40}{100}=\frac{47}{100}$. This step demonstrates the understanding of adding fractions, which is covered by ""4.NF.C.5"".

Lastly, the student must recognize that the result, $\frac{47}{100}$, is equivalent to 0.47 liters. This requires understanding the relationship between fractions and decimals, which is represented by ""4.NBT.A.2""."

Explanation:

To solve this problem, the student needs to be able to interpret the line plots and compare the snowfall amounts given in the problem statement to the amounts shown in the line plots. The snowfall amounts are given in fractions, so the student must be able to work with fractions and compare them using the symbols >, =, and <. Additionally, the student must be able to create or interpret a line plot, which is a graphical representation of a data set. The line plot in this problem includes fractions, so the student must be able to read and write fractions in numerals, number names, and expanded form. Finally, the student must be able to compare multi-digit numbers, as some of the snowfall amounts include whole numbers."

Explanation:
To answer this question, the student needs to understand the concept of place value (5.NBT.A.1) to calculate the cost of the additional hours. The cost for the first hour is given as $6.50, and the cost for each additional hour is $1.50. The student needs to find the cost for 2 additional hours (since the total rental time is 3 hours) and add it to the cost of the first hour.

To calculate the cost for the additional hours, the student can use the division concept (5.NBT.B.6) to divide the number of additional hours (2) by the divisor (1) to get the quotient (2). Then, multiply the quotient by the dividend ($1.50) to get the product ($3.00).

Finally, the student needs to add the cost of the first hour ($6.50) and the cost for the additional hours ($3.00) to get the total price ($9.50). The student may also need to understand how to add decimals (5.NBT.B.7) to find the total price."

Explanation:
To answer this question, students need to understand the properties of different quadrilaterals, such as rhombuses, squares, trapezoids, and parallelograms. They should know that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and opposite angles equal, a square is a special type of rhombus with all angles equal, a trapezoid is a quadrilateral with only one pair of parallel sides, and a parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel and equal.

Using this knowledge, students can determine that statement C is true because every rhombus has opposite sides parallel and equal, making it a parallelogram. Statement A is not true because not all rhombuses have all angles equal, making them not necessarily squares. Statement B is not true because trapezoids have only one pair of parallel sides, so they cannot be squares. Statement D is not true because not all trapezoids have opposite sides parallel and equal, making them not necessarily parallelograms."

Explanation:
To solve this question, the student needs to understand the concept of equivalent fractions, which is covered in ""4.NF.A.1"". This standard states that a fraction a/b is equivalent to a fraction (n * a)/(n * b) if they represent the same size. In this question, the student needs to identify which fractions are equivalent to 4/1.

The student also needs to be able to compare fractions with different numerators and denominators, as stated in ""4.NF.A.2"". This standard involves creating common denominators or numerators, or comparing to a benchmark fraction such as 1/2. In this question, the student can create a common denominator to compare the fractions to 4/1.

Finally, the student needs to understand that a fraction a/b with a > 1 can be understood as a sum of fractions 1/b, as stated in ""4.NF.B.3.a"". This standard involves understanding that a fraction with a numerator greater than the denominator can be broken down into unit fractions. In this question, the student can use this understanding to see that 4/1 is equal to 4/10 + 4/100 + 4/1000, and can compare the other fractions to these unit fractions."

Explanation:
To answer this question, the student needs to understand what a fraction represents on a number line (3.NF.A.2). Specifically, they need to understand that fractions are represented as points on the number line, with the denominator indicating the number of equal parts the whole is divided into, and the numerator indicating the number of parts that the point represents.

In this question, the student needs to identify which fraction corresponds to the point G on the number line. To do this, they need to understand that the whole number line is divided into 8 equal parts, as indicated by the tick marks between the whole numbers. The point G is located between 0 and 1, so it represents a fraction of the distance between 0 and 1.

To determine which fraction corresponds to point G, the student needs to determine how many of the 8 equal parts the point represents. Since point G is located slightly more than halfway between 0 and 1, it represents more than 4 of the 8 equal parts. Specifically, it represents 5 of the 8 equal parts, which can be represented as the fraction 5/8.

Therefore, the student needs to understand fractions as quantities on the number line (3.NF.A.2), how fractions are represented as a numerator over a denominator (3.NF.A.1), and how to interpret a point on a number line as a fraction (3.MD.A.1)."

3. 5.NF.B.5.a: Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing), by understanding that multiplying a number by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying that number by the numerator and dividing it by the denominator.

Explanation:

To solve this question, students need to understand that multiplying a number by a fraction is equivalent to dividing that number by the reciprocal of the fraction. Therefore, to make the statement true, the missing value should be a fraction that is less than 1 but greater than 0, so that when 11 is multiplied by that fraction, the result is greater than 11.

The given answer choices are all whole numbers, so students need to convert them to fractions by placing them over 1. For example, the whole number 3 can be expressed as the fraction 3/1.

Now, students can divide 11 by the reciprocal of each fraction to see which one results in a value greater than 11. For example, for the fraction 3/1, the reciprocal is 1/3, so dividing 11 by 1/3 results in a value of 33, which is greater than 11.

Therefore, the missing value should be a fraction that is less than 1 but greater than 0, and when 11 is multiplied by that fraction, the result is greater than 11. The correct answer is 1/5, which is not given in the answer choices. However, students can select the three answer choices that are closest to 1/5, which are B 7, C 8, and E 6. These three fractions, when expressed as 7/1, 8/1, and 6/1, have reciprocals that are close to 1/5, and when 11 is divided by those reciprocals, the results are close to 11.

Therefore, the knowledge components required to answer this question are those related to interpreting fractions as division, multiplying fractions by whole numbers, and interpreting multiplication as scaling."

3. 3.MD.C.7: Relate area to the operations of multiplication and addition.

Explanation:
To find the area of a square with a perimeter of 32 ft, you need to understand what area is and how it is measured (3.MD.C.5.a). You also need to know how to measure area by counting unit squares (3.MD.C.6), in this case, square feet. Lastly, you need to understand the relationship between the side length of a square and its area, which is an application of multiplication (3.MD.C.7). The area of a square is the square of its side length, so if the perimeter is 32 ft, then each side has a length of 32/4 = 8 ft, and the area is 8*8 = 64 square feet."

Explanation:
To solve this problem, the student needs to first find the total number of eggs by adding the number of eggs each person has (37 + 49 + 14 = 100). Since eggs are sold in cartons of 12, the student then needs to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of cartons (100 / 12 = 8 remainder 4). The remainder of 4 indicates that there will be 4 eggs left over if all cartons are sold."
