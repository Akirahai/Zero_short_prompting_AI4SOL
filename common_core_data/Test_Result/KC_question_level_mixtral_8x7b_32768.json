Without a vaccine, the chances of getting infected with either virus after getting bitten by an infected mosquito are 50%. Jack is taking an experimental malaria vaccine that reduces the chances of getting infected after getting bitten by 50%. If Jack gets bitten by a random mosquito, what is the percentage chance he catches either Zika virus or malaria?",
        "Solution": "First find Jack's chances of getting bitten by an infected mosquito: 40% + 20% = 60%\\nThe chance of being infected by a mosquito with after being bitten: 60% * 50% = 30%\\nThen find the chances of getting ill after receiving the vaccine: 30% * 50% = 15%\\n#### 15",

        "Solution": "In order to produce a multiple of 63, we must choose at least two factors of 3 and one factor of 7 among the prime factorizations of the two numbers we choose.  We count the number of ways in which we can do this by considering the four multiples of 7 in our list.  There are two which are not multiples of 3 (7 and 35) and two that are multiples of 3 but not 9 (21 and 42).  Each of 7 and 35 can be paired with 27 to give a multiple of 63, so that's two successes.  Each of 21 and 42 can be paired with any of 3, 27, or 51, which gives another $2\\\\cdot 3 = 6$ successes.  Finally, we can choose both 21 and 42, and we have a total of $2+6+1 = 9$ successes.\\n\\nSince there are $\\\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total ways to choose a pair of numbers from the list, the probability that a randomly chosen pair of numbers will have a product which is a multiple of 63 is $\\\\frac{9}{21}=\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{3}{7}}$.",

        "Solution": "We notice that 16 divides $78+82$ as well as $79+81$ and also 80.  Therefore the sum is congruent to  \\\\[75+76+77\\\\pmod{16}.\\\\]Since these numbers are congruent to $-5$, $-4$, and $-3$ modulo 16, this can be computed as  \\\\[-5-4-3\\\\equiv-12\\\\pmod{16}.\\\\]Finally, since $-12\\\\equiv4\\\\pmod{16}$ the remainder we seek is $\\\\boxed{4}$",

The preimage has an area of 4 square units, so its side length is 2 units.
